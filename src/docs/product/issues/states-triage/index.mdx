You can sort and prioritize Issues on the [**Issues** page](https://sentry.sentry.io/issues/) in Sentry by paying attention to the status tags attached to every Issue. It's important to note that an Issue can only have **one status at a time.**

Here's a list of all the statuses and the conditions for creating them:

| Status         | Condition                                             | Custom Search Term |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **New**        | An issue that was created in the last 3 days.         | is:new             |
| **Ongoing**    | An issue that was created more than 3 days ago.       | is:ongoing         |
| **Escalating** | An issue that's exceeded its forecasted event volume. | is:escalating      |
| **Regressed**  | A resolved issue that's come up again.                | is:regressed       |
| **Archived**   | An issue that's been marked as archived.              | is:archived        |
| **Resolved**   | An issue that's been marked as fixed.                 | is:resolved        |

One way to limit the Issues that you see is by selecting a tab at the top of the **Issues** page. On the “Unresolved tab” you'll find: New, Ongoing, Escalating, and Regressed issues, but you can also narrow down further by choosing the “For Review”, “New”, “Escalating”, “Ongoing”, or “Archived” tabs.

## Manually Triaging Issues

While some Issue statuses are added and updated automatically, you can manually `Archive` or `Resolve` an Issue, which will also change its status.

### Archive

You can manually archive Issues that are less pressing or not applicable to you or your team. This will change their status to `Archived` and remove them from the Issues list. Sentry will automatically bring an Issue back to the top of the list and change its status to `Escalating` if the events in that Issue significantly increase over a short period of time. There's also an option to mark an Issue as `Archived` for:

- A set period of time
- Until it occurs a set number of times
- Until a set number of users are affected

### Resolve

You can manually mark an Issue as `Resolved` when it’s been fixed. You can also specify further by resolving it in:

- Your next release
- A current release
- Another release

or

- By [including the issue ID in a commit](/product/releases/associate-commits/?original_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.sentry.io%2Fproduct%2Fissues%2Fstates-triage%2F#resolve-issues-by-commit)

If the same Issue comes back, its status will be automatically changed to `Regressed`.

### Delete

You can remove an Issue from the Issue list by deleting it, but it will reappear as a new Issue if it recurs.

There's also an option to `Delete and Discard Forever`, which will make it so that the Issue is never seen again, even if it reoccurs. Any future events will be discarded automatically and won't count towards [your quota](/product/accounts/quotas/).

<Note>

You can only delete [Error Issues](/product/issues/issue-details/error-issues/?original_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.sentry.io%2Fproduct%2Fissues%2Fstates-triage%2F). Other Issue categories, (such as [Performance Issues](/product/issues/issue-details/performance-issues/?original_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.sentry.io%2Fproduct%2Fissues%2Fstates-triage%2F)), don't support this feature.
