<Include name="only-error-issues-note.mdx" />

Sentry uses commit metadata from your source code repositories to help you resolve your issues faster. This is done by suggesting _suspect commits_ that might have introduced an error right in your **Issue Details** page. It also allows Sentry to display _suggested assignees_ — the list of the authors of those commits — and suggest their assignment to resolve the issue.

Now that you've created a release, you can tell Sentry which commits are associated with this latest version of your code; this is called _commit tracking_.

## Step 1: Integrate Your GitHub Account and Repository

1. To integrate GitHub with your Sentry org, follow the instructions in [our GitHub documentation](/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/).

2. Add the `frontend-tutorial` repository from your GitHub account.

   ![Add project repository](configure-scms-01.png)

3. Click the "Code Mappings" tab

4. Add a code mapping between the `frontend-tutorial` repository and your Sentry project and the `main` or `master` branch depending on your repository. Tell Sentry that your components live in the `src/` directory:

   ![Add code mapping](configure-scms-09.png)

## Step 2: Set Up Commit Tracking

A _release_ is a version of your code deployed to an environment. See the [Releases](/product/releases/) documentation to learn more. Sentry uses releases to match up your source maps and source code. Releases can also be used to enable Sentry's [Suspect Commits](/product/issues/suspect-commits/) feature.

The Sentry webpack plugin can automatically configure release information and send it to Sentry when you create a new build of your project. To enable this feature, add the following lines of code to `webpack.config.js` in your Sentry webpack plugin config:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
    sentryWebpackPlugin({
      org: "shana-et",
      project: "test-tutorial",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained by creating an internal integration
      // at https://<organiaztion_id>.sentry.io/settings/developer-settings/
      // and need "Release: Admin" and "Organization: Read & Write" permissions
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

      // Enable automatically creating releases and associating commits
      release: {
        create: true,
        setCommits: {
          auto: true,
        },
      },
    }),
```

We need to add some commits for Sentry to detect!

1. Go back to your `frontend-tutorial` project and stop it with Ctrl + C.

1. Edit line 97. This will make sure Sentry recognizes a new error that it can associate with the release you will create:

   ```javascript {filename:src/components/App.js}
   this.myCodeIsMorePerfect();
   ```

1. Add all your changes to git with:

   ```bash
   git commit -am 'Added a new error and some other stuff'
   git push
   ```

1. Create another production build. During this process, the webpack plugin will create a new release and associate your commit to that release.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

1. Run your production build:

   ```bash
   npx serve build
   ```

## Step 3: Suspect commits and suggested assignees

Now suspect commits and suggested assignees should start appearing on the **Issue Details** page. Sentry determines these using files observed in the stack trace, authors of those files, and ownership rules.

1. Refresh the browser and generate an error by adding products to your cart and clicking "Checkout".

1. Check your email for the alert about the new error. Notice that a new "Suspect Commits" section has been added to the email.

1. Click "View on Sentry" to open the **Issue Details** page.

1. In the main area of the page, notice the "SUSPECT COMMITS" section now points to a commit that most likely introduced the error. You can click on the commit button to see the actual commit details on GitHub.

1. In the right side panel, under "Suggested Assignees", you'll see that the author of the suspect commit is listed as a suggested assignee for this issue.

   ![Suggested Assignees](configure-scms-04.png)

   You can assign the suggested assignee to the issue by clicking on the icon. However, in this case, the commit originates in the repository upstream, and the suggested assignee is not part of your organization. Alternatively, you can manually assign the issue to other users or teams assigned to the project.

1. Click on the "ASSIGNEE" dropdown and select one of the project users or teams.

   ![Suspect Commit](configure-scms-05.png)

1. In the main area of the page, under "TAGS", find the `release` tag and **hover over** the "i" icon.

1. In the popup that appears, notice the release now contains the commit data.

   ![Assign Manually](configure-scms-06.png)

1. Click on the release "i" icon to open the **Release Details** page.

1. Select the "Commits" tab. Notice that release now contains the associated list of commits.

## Step 4: Using Stack Trace Links

Stack trace links allows you to jump from a stack trace in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to the corresponding file in your source code provider. This is done by matching the file path in the stack trace to the file path in your source code provider.

1. Go to the **Issue Details** page for the error you generated in the previous step.

2. If the code mapping is set up correctly, in the stack trace you should see a link with "Open this line in GitHub":
