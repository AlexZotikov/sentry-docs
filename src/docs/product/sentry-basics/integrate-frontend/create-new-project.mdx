This section walks you through how to create a new project in your Sentry account and set up alerts for that project.

## Step 1: Create a Project

_Projects_ allow you to scope events to a distinct application in your organization and assign responsibility and ownership to specific users and teams within your organization. You can create a project for a particular language or framework used in your application. For example, you might have separate projects for your API server and frontend client. For more information see [best practices for creating projects](/product/accounts/getting-started/#4-create-projects)

1. Log in to your [Sentry organization](https://sentry.io).

1. Select **Projects** from the left side navigation menu to display the list of all your projects.

1. Click "Create Project".

   If there are no projects in your account, you might be redirected to the onboarding wizard to create your first project.

   - Select the language or framework for your project based on the code you wish to monitor â€” in this case, "React".

   - Under "Set your default alert settings", select "I'll create my own alerts later".

   - Give the project a name in the "Project name" field.

   - Assign a team to the project by selecting one in the "Team" dropdown.

     > If you haven't defined any teams, you can either select the default org team (the team that has the same name as your Sentry org) or click on the "+" button to create a new team.

   - Click "Create Project". This takes you to the configuration page. Read through the quick Getting Started guide.

1. Copy the "DSN" key and keep it handy as you will be copying the key into the source code. You can also find this information any time in **[Project] > Settings > Client Keys (DSN)**.

   > The DSN (or Data Source Name) tells the SDK where to send the events, associating them with the project you just created.

1. Click on the "Got it!" button at the bottom to create the project.
