This section walks you through how to create a new project in your Sentry account and set up alerts for that project.

## 1. Create a Project

_Projects_ allow you to scope events to a distinct application in your organization and assign responsibility and ownership to specific users and teams within your organization. You can create a project for a particular language or framework used in your application. For example, you might have separate projects for your API server and frontend client. For more information see [best practices for creating projects](/product/accounts/getting-started/#4-create-projects)

1. Log in to your [Sentry organization](https://sentry.io).

1. Select **Projects** from the left side navigation menu to display the list of all your projects.

1. Click "Create Project".

   If there are no projects in your account, you might be redirected to the onboarding wizard to create your first project.

   - Select the language or framework for your project based on the code you wish to monitor â€” in this case, "React".

   - Under "Set your alert frequency", select "Alert me on every new issue".

   - Name your project in the "Project name" field.

   - Assign a team to the project by selecting one in the "Team" dropdown.

   > If you haven't defined any teams, you can either select the default org team (the team that has the same name as your Sentry org) or click on the "+" button to create a new team.

   - Click "Create Project". This takes you to the quick Configure React SDK guide, which provides an overview of how to configure the SDK. This tutorial covers the SDK setup in more detail.

1. Copy the "DSN" key and keep it handy. You'll need to paste it into your source code so the SDK knows where to send events to. You can also find this information any time in **[Project] > Settings > Client Keys (DSN)**.

   <!--- ![Copy DSN](create-new-project-04.png) --->

   > The DSN (or Data Source Name) tells the SDK where to send the events, associating them with the project you just created.

1. Click "Take me to Issues" to go to your new project's **Issues** page.
