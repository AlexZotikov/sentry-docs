#### Install

Our browser profiling integration is built upon the profiler exposed by the [JS Self-Profiling API](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/), it is therefor in beta stage and is likely to only to move out as the official spec progresses. There are obviously risks with using a beta package - we've made sure that the SDK gracefully degrades in unsupported environments.

Please note that since profiling API is currently only implemented in Chromium based browsers, the profiles collected will inherintly be biased towards that demographic - this is something you need to be aware of when making decisions.

Install our JavaScript browser SDK using either `yarn` or `npm`, the minimum version that supports profiling is @TODO

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/browser

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/browser
```
