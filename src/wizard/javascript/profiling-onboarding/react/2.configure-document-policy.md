#### Add Document-Policy:js-profiling header

In order to enable the profiler to start, the document response header has to include a header key `Document-Policy` with value of `js-profiling`.

Depending on your server, how you do this will vary. If you are using a server like express, you can do this like via the [response.set](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.set) function.

```js
app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  response.set("Document-Policy", "js-profiling");
  response.sendFile("index.html");
});
```
