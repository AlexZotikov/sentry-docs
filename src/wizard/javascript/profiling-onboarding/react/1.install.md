#### Install

Because our browser profiling integration is built on top of the profiler exposed by the [JS Self-Profiling API](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/), it's in beta and will likely only move out once the official spec progresses. There are some risks involved with using a beta package. We've made sure that the SDK gracefully degrades in unsupported environments.

Please note, that since profiling API is currently only implemented in Chromium based browsers, the profiles collected will inherently be biased towards that demographic.

Install our JavaScript browser SDK using either `yarn` or `npm`, the minimum version that supports profiling is @TODO

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/react

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/react
```
